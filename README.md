# Fate-Tarot

Basically the objective of the game, is to have more points than your opponent
at the end of the game. 
Points are calculated based on the card you pick and the position it is in. 
Each card has a numerical value from 0 - 20. 
The numerical value of each card only changes in terms of it being inverse.
For example; the world card has a numerical value of 20 while upright. 
If the player draws the card upright then they receive 20 points. 
But if the card is drawn upside down then the inverse happens.
They instead must subtract 20 points. 
This rule applies to every card except for the card with a value of 0.
This card creates an exception, and can either make you win or lose the game.
The fool is the card with a numerical value of 0 regardless of its position. 
If the fool is drawn upright then you automatically win. 
If the fool is drawn upside down then you automatically lose.
The game ends if the fool is drawn, but if it is not drawn;
the game continues on until a maximum of 5 cards for each side has been drawn.
After 5 cards on both sides have been drawn the results are calculated-
and shown. 
A winner will be picked based on whom had the higher score. 
It is possible for a player to have a score within the negatives.
